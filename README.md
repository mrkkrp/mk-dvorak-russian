This is what I use to type Russian with Dvorak layout on OS level. Stolen
from here (with some edits):

https://github.com/alezost/dvorak-layouts.el

## Installation

Put it on your load path, then do `(require 'mk-dvorak-russian)`.

This is probably not a good package for MELPA, so it's not there. However, I
prefer keep it as a separate repository and it's not going to be under
intensive development I guess, so you can just download or clone it.

## Usage

It depends on how you deal with input methods. For a start, try <kbd>M-x
set-input-method mk-dvorak-russian</kbd>.
